Becoming a hardware and IoT (Internet of Things) penetration tester requires a combination of education, hands-on experience, and continuous learning. Here is a roadmap to help you get started:

1. Fundamentals:
- [ ] Learn basic programming languages such as Python, C/C++, and JavaScript.
  - Python: Learn Python as it is a versatile, high-level language used for scripting, automation, and data analysis. Familiarize yourself with Python libraries for security and networking, such as Scapy, Requests, and Beautiful Soup. Aim to develop basic to intermediate coding skills.
  - C/C++: Learn C and C++ as they are commonly used in embedded systems, firmware, and low-level programming. Understanding memory management, pointers, and low-level operations will help you identify vulnerabilities in hardware and IoT devices.
  - JavaScript: Learn JavaScript as it is essential for web-based applications and IoT devices with web interfaces. Familiarize yourself with the basics of the language, as well as its usage in client-side and server-side applications (e.g., Node.js).
- [ ] Understand computer networking, including concepts like TCP/IP, OSI model, and network protocols.
  - TCP/IP: Learn the basics of the Internet Protocol Suite, including how data is transmitted, IP addressing, and routing. Understand the differences between TCP and UDP, and learn about other essential protocols, such as ICMP and ARP.
  - OSI Model: Understand the seven-layer OSI model and the functions of each layer. Knowing how data flows through the layers and the protocols used at each level will help you identify potential vulnerabilities.
  - Network protocols: Familiarize yourself with common application layer protocols, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, and DNS. Learn about IoT-specific protocols like MQTT, CoAP, and Zigbee.
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with operating systems, especially Linux, as it is widely used in IoT devices.
  - Linux: Learn to use Linux, as many IoT devices and servers run on it. Gain proficiency in the command line, file system, and package management. Learn about Linux-based security tools and distributions, such as Kali Linux and Parrot OS.

2. IoT and Hardware Basics:
- [ ] Learn about microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, ESP32), sensors, and actuators.
- [ ] Gain an understanding of IoT protocols like MQTT, CoAP, and HTTP.
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with hardware components like memory, CPUs, and SoCs.
- [ ] Acquire knowledge about different IoT platforms and frameworks, such as Raspberry Pi and NodeMCU.
- [ ] IoT and Hardware Security:

3. Study hardware attack vectors like side-channel attacks, fault injection, and reverse engineering.
- [ ] Explore IoT-specific vulnerabilities and threats, such as weak authentication and insecure firmware updates.
- [ ] Learn about secure boot and trusted execution environments to protect sensitive data.
- [ ] Understand embedded device security concepts, like secure storage and secure communication.
- [ ] Penetration Testing and Tools:

4. Gain experience with common penetration testing tools, such as Nmap, Wireshark, and Metasploit.
- [ ] Learn about IoT-specific tools like Firmware Analysis Toolkit (FAT), Shodan, and JTAGulator.
- [ ] Practice reverse engineering with tools like IDA Pro, Ghidra, and Binwalk.
- [ ] Explore hardware hacking tools like logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, and multimeters.
- [ ] Real-world Experience:

5. Participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and other security challenges to test your skills.
- [ ] Tinker with IoT devices and hardware platforms to gain hands-on experience.
- [ ] Contribute to open-source projects related to IoT security.
- [ ] Attend security conferences, workshops, and webinars to stay updated with the latest trends and research.
- [ ] Certifications:

6. Consider obtaining relevant certifications, such as Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), CompTIA Security+, and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH).
- [ ] Pursue IoT-specific certifications like Offensive Security Wireless Professional (OSWP) or Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) IoT Security.
- [ ] Networking and Professional Development:

7. Join online forums, communities, and social media groups to connect with professionals in the field.
- [ ] Attend security conferences and events to network with industry experts and potential employers.
- [ ] Remember, becoming a hardware and IoT pentester is an ongoing process. Stay curious, and continuously learn and adapt to stay ahead in this rapidly evolving field.

To be hirable as a self-educated pentester, follow these goals:
1. Build a strong foundation in the fundamentals mentioned above. Develop good programming skills, understand networking concepts, and gain proficiency in Linux.
2. Create a portfolio showcasing your skills and projects. Develop PoCs (Proof of Concepts) for vulnerability discoveries, write blog posts about your security research, and share your contributions to open-source projects.
3. Participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and security challenges to demonstrate your skills and knowledge. This will help you gain practical experience and improve your problem-solving abilities.
4. Obtain relevant certifications, such as OSCP, CEH, or Security+. These certifications will validate your skills and knowledge, making you more attractive to potential employers.
5. Network with professionals in the field. Attend security conferences, join online forums, and engage with the cybersecurity community on social media. Building connections can help you learn about job opportunities and industry trends.
6. Stay up-to-date with the latest security news, research, and developments. Continuously learning and adapting is crucial in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.
