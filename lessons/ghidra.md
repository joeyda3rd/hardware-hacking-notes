Sure, here's a detailed seA self-guided learning plan for becoming proficient at using Ghidra:

**Part 1: Getting Started with Ghidra**

1. **Understanding Reverse Engineering:** Before diving into Ghidra, it's important to understand what reverse engineering is and why it's done. Spend some time reading articles and watching videos on the topic. A good starting point is the Wikipedia page on Reverse engineering (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering).

2. **Introduction to Ghidra:** Read about Ghidra on the official website (https://ghidra-sre.org/) and on the Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghidra) to understand its background and purpose.

3. **Installation:** Download and install Ghidra from the official website. There's a comprehensive installation guide provided (https://ghidra-sre.org/InstallationGuide.html).

**Part 2: Learning to Use Ghidra**

1. **Ghidra Basics:** Go through the Ghidra User Guide (https://ghidra.re/ghidra_docs/userguide.html) to understand the basics.

2. **Video Tutorial:** Watch the video tutorial "Ghidra Tutorial - Getting Started & Reverse Engineering" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTGTnrgjuGA) to see Ghidra in action.

**Part 3: Hands-on Practice**

1. **Simple Binary Analysis:** Download simple binary files (such as those from http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/) and practice disassembling and analyzing them in Ghidra.

2. **Function Identification:** Learn to identify functions, variables, and other components in the disassembled code.

**Part 4: Digging Deeper**

1. **Deeper Understanding:** Watch more advanced tutorials, such as "Ghidra Reverse Engineering for Beginners" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vsu3v5Ia7M), to get a deeper understanding of the tool.

2. **Learning Assembly:** Understand basic assembly language since you'll encounter it a lot. A good resource for this is the website (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/index.htm).

**Part 5: Advanced Concepts**

1. **Scripting in Ghidra:** Learn about Ghidra's scripting capabilities (Python and Java) which can help automate and streamline some tasks.
    - Ghidra's official documentation includes a section dedicated to scripting (https://ghidra.re/ghidra_docs/api/index.html). It's a good place to start learning about Ghidra's scripting capabilities.
    - There are numerous scripts available on GitHub (https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/tree/master/Ghidra/Features/Python/ghidra_scripts) that you can study to understand how to write your own scripts in Ghidra.
    - YouTube tutorials like "Automating Ghidra - Intro to Ghidra Scripting with Python" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPUtJV9g0zM) can provide a good visual guide to scripting.

3. **Deobfuscation and Decryption:** Learn how to handle obfuscated or encrypted code in Ghidra. This could involve further reading and practicing with more complex binary files.
    - https://cryptopals.com/
    - https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Reversing+and+decrypting+a+.NET+RAT/25220
    - Ghidra's official documentation provides some information on how to handle obfuscated code.

**Part 6: Final Project**

1. **Project:** Find a complex piece of software, maybe an old video game or a utility tool, and try to reverse engineer it. Try to identify the functions, data structures, and if possible, make changes and recompile the software.

Remember, reverse engineering is a complex field that requires a solid understanding of how software works at a fundamental level. Take your time with each step, don't rush, and make sure you fully understand each concept before moving onto the next. This learning journey requires patience and persistence, but it's a highly rewarding skill to have.
